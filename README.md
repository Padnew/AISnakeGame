# AISnakeGame

Firstly this is not my original work, I created this by following a tutorial by Patrick Loeber. 
To run this project simply run the agent.py file, this AI is not too taxing on your computer since it uses CPU only. 
It takes around 90-100 games(10 minutes) for the AI to get a good consistent grasp on the movements and how to avoid itself.
If the snake seems to be just completely the same moves over and over (Spinning in a circle) then just be paitent. The random moves should kick it and throw it off course.
